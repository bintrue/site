### General information:

* Programming languege: c++
* Time: 2012 Aug 3 / 16:00
* Place: Budapest ( details in e-mail )
* Contact: peter.ferenc.hajdu at gmail dot com

### Suggested katas:

* _Anagram_: Write a program to generate all potential anagrams of an input string.
* [Conway's Game of Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life)

_Do not come unprepared. Spend some time going through the problems._

### Agenda:

* Quick overview of dojo rules.
* Collectively decide which kata(s) to implement.
* Having fun :D
* Short review of the session.
* Collecting improvement ideas.

### Retrospective:

* Finished katas:
  * Anagram generator

* Things we have learned:
  * \#pragma once
  * std::next_permutation
  * std::unique
  * TS_ASSERT and const iterator fiasco
  * std::set insert <- iteration hint
  * vim -p

* Too much noise and chaos:
  * Non pair programmers are allowed to talk only if they possess the token.
  * Offtopic discussion is allowed only during the breaks.
  * Pay more attention to pair programming.
  * Use shorter iterations: 10 mins
  * Longer explanations are allowed between pair shifts.

* General improvement ideas:
  * Filter out stl coverage information.
  * Use VCS.
  * Install a userfriendly editor with gui.
  * Everyone should bring his favourite keyboard.
