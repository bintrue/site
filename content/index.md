__bintrue__ is a group of software engineers living in Budapest whose goal is to share knowledge
and develop coding skills. We gather biweekly to have some beer together and discuss awesome project
ideas after a coding dojo session.

You can read more about our dojo events [here](/dojo).

If you happen to live near Budapest and would like to join please don't hesitate to contact us.
